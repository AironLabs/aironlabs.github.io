<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

The data we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to App Usage's website or Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Sharing of Your Information</h2>
<p>Personal Information: We may share your personal information with third parties outside the Company and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates in some circumstances, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We share your personal information, including name, email, location and photo, with others within your App Usage friends.</li>
  <li>We may share your personal information with our third-party business partners, vendors and consultants who perform services on our behalf or who help us provide our Services, such as accounting, managerial, technical, marketing or analytic services.</li>
  <li>We may share your personal information, including your location data, with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
  <li>Any information or content that you voluntarily post to the website or to our Facebook page will automatically be available to the public. We may publicly post your reviews and comments online on our website or mobile app, or link your reviews to third party websites.</li>
  <li>We may aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics of our data and may share that anonymized and/or aggregated data with third parties. For example, we may share de-identified location data with third parties that analyze location and movement trends.</li>
  <li>We may at any time buy or sell/divest the company, or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or businesses. Personal information such as customer names and email addresses, and other user information related to the Service will likely be one of the items transferred in these types of transactions. We may also share, transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions or similar transactions or proceedings.</li>
  <li>Except as described above, we will not disclose personal information to third parties (including law enforcement, other government entity, or civil litigant; excluding our subcontractors) unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if in our sole discretion, we determine it is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any claims or allegations, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of App Usage, our Users or others.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How we protect your information</h2>
<p>App Usage cares about the security of your information and uses commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information we collect and that we share with our service providers. However, no security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<h2>Your Choices About Your Information</h2>
<p>You may, of course, decline to submit any personal information through the Service, in which case App Usage may not be able to provide its Services to you.</p>
<p><strong>Modifying Your Account Information and Settings:</strong> You may modify your account information, update or amend your personal information, or change your password at any time by logging in to your account. You can also stop receiving promotional email communications from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe link” provided in such communications. We make every effort to promptly process all unsubscribe requests. As noted above, you may not opt out of Service-related communications (e.g., account verification, parental consent notification, order confirmations, change or updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). If you have any questions about reviewing or modifying your account information, you can contact us directly at iosApp Usage@gmail.com.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Tracking and Advertising:</strong> We may share, or we may permit third party ad networks, social media companies, and other third party services to collect, information about the browsing behavior of our users of Service through cookies, social plug-ins, or other tracking technology. We may permit third party online advertising networks to collect information about your use of our Services over time, including location information, so that they may play or display ads that may be relevant to your interests on our Service as well as on other websites or services, or on other devices you may use. Typically, the information is collected through cookies or similar tracking technologies. You may be able to “opt out” of the collection of information through cookies or other tracking technology by actively managing the settings on your browser or mobile device. Please refer to your browser's or mobile device's technical information for instructions on how to delete, disable, and/or limit the use of cookies or other tracking/recording tools. Depending on your mobile device, you may not be able to control all tracking technologies through your device settings but you can uninstall the app if you do not want to have tracking information automatically collected. You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings on your browser or device. For example, you may be able to opt-out of some interest-based advertising on your mobile device by selecting “limit ad tracking” (iOS) or “opt-out of interest based ads” (Android). To learn more about interest-based advertising and how you may opt-out of some of this tracking, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising Initiative's online resources, at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices and/or the DAA's resources at www.aboutads.info/choices. You may also be able to opt-out of some � but not all � interest-based ads served by mobile ad networks by visiting http://youradchoices.com/appchoices and downloading the mobile AppChoices app. If you have any questions about third party tracking and advertising, you can contact us directly at iosApp Usage@gmail.com.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Location Sharing:</strong> We may share your personal information, including location data, with third parties so that they may play or display ads that may be relevant to your interests, for example by sending you an ad for a local business, or so that they may conduct research, analyze trends and perform other analytics or reporting functions. We do not share your personal information and location data with third parties for advertising purposes if you have selected “Limit Ad Tracking” or “Opt-Out of Interest Based Ads” on your mobile device. You can opt-out of having your location data shared with these third parties by adjusting your settings on your mobile device to prohibit App Usage from collecting your location data. For example, depending on your mobile device, you may be able to “Turn location services ‘off.' You can also adjust your device settings to withdraw permission for the App Usage app to access location data. Please note that your App Usage app may not be able to provide all of our Services to you if you disable access to location data through your device settings.</p>
<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
